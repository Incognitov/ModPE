# Phantom
A Minecraft: Pocket Edition mod pack containing unique, fun and essential features.

Hey there! This document is to help you place the font files!

1. You need to download a file browser. You don't need to root your tablet/phone.
2. Place the "phantom" folder into "mnt/sdcard/games/com.mojang/". Or "storage/emulated/0/games/com.mojang/".
3. Import the .js file into BlockLauncher.
4. Load an offline world.
5. Enjoy!

**NOTE: This mod will not work properly without the font files which are not being distributed on Github, in that case please contact me if you are interested in using the mod fully.**
